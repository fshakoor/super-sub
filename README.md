# The Super Sub: Impact of Attacking Substitutes in the Premier League (2014–2024)

## Introduction
This project investigates the impact of "Super Subs"—attacking players brought on as substitutes who score crucial goals late in matches. 

Specifically, I explore whether these players are more likely than expected to score goals that equalize or win games after being subbed on when their team is tied or losing.

## Hypothesis
**H₀ (Null):** Attacking substitutes do not have a significantly higher chance of scoring game-tying or winning goals compared to starters, when adjusting for playing time and match context.  
**H₁ (Alternative):** Attacking substitutes (Super Subs) have a significantly higher chance of scoring game-tying or winning goals, relative to their time on the pitch and the state of the match.

## Scope
- **League:** English Premier League  
- **Time Period:** 2013–2024 (9 seasons)  
- **Focus:** Substitutes entering after the 70th minute in tied or losing game states

## Constraints
- Publicly available data sources may limit exact match state (fatigue, team strength etc.) at time of substitution or goal
- Player position may not always be consistent across datasets

## Biases
- Stronger teams tend to have deeper benches, possibly skewing substitute impact
- Tactical shifts or injuries may affect the context of substitutions
- Late-game chaos and small sample size may distort scoring likelihoods
